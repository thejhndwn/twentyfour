# twenty four 

This houses some code for a card/tile based game called twenty four ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle))). Still a WIP.
This game is composed of a frontend, backend, and database.
- frontend controls the game mechanics
- backend controls game direction and fraud detection and user authetnication
- database stores things like game states and scores

# tech stack
It's a typical PERN stack, using Drizzle as the ORM

# installation
Currently the download is very complicated, since there's no containerization for the database setup. But installation would follow a typical npm setup. Then you're on your own :p

# there is no cd since the project is incomplete

# todo
- complete the arithmetic calculations in the frontend
- complete the user authentication stuff
- add containerization
-
